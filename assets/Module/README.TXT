It seems the system for loading the code contained in the message has changed since the bbcode update, you can use $ ... $ for the code (not required), use $$ ... $$ for the latexcode to load (required to work)

It seems that these modules can all be completely replaced by our new bbcode system, we encourage you to use the new feature (bbcode)
